                <h2>Caregiving</h2>
                <h3>What is Caregiving?</h3>
                <p>Caregiving is providing care for the daily needs of someone that is unable to care for themselves.  The care my include addressing the physical and emotional needs of someone that requires continuous support and attention.  The individual could be a loved one or a friend.  Most caregiving occurs in the home</p>
                <h3>What does a Caregiver do?</h3>
                <p>Caregivers perform a wide variety of tasks to assist someone else in his or her daily life, for example, balancing a checkbook, grocery shopping, assisting with doctor’s appointments, giving medications, or helping someone to eat, take a bath or dress. Many family members and friends do not consider such assistance and care “caregiving”—they are just doing what comes naturally to them: taking care of someone they love. But that care may be required for months or years, and may take an emotional, physical and financial toll on caregiving families.</p>
                <p>For some people, caregiving occurs gradually over time. For others, it can happen overnight. Caregivers may be full- or part-time; live with their loved one, or provide care from a distance. For the most part, friends, neighbors, and most of all, families, provide—without pay—the vast majority of care.</p>
                <h3>Are You A Caregiver?</h3>
                <p>You might be a caregiver to a partner/spouse, parent, child, family member, friend, or neighbor if you are providing assistance with any part of their daily living. People often require assistance from a family caregiver because of age, medical condition, decline in overall health, injury, illness or disability.</p>
                <h2>Caregiving Roles</h2>
                <h3>The important roles fulfilled by a Caregiver</h3>
                <h4>The caregiver fulfills critical needs for the one needing care.  According to the Patient Empowerment Network, the caregiver can assume the following responsibilities:</h4>
                <li><h4>Advocate.</h4><p> Sometimes patients are not completely forthcoming with their physical or emotional needs and tend to downplay their pain when speaking with doctors. Caretakers play an important role in honest communication between doctors and patients by upholding patient preferences for treatment options when the patient cannot or will not speak for him or herself.</p></li>
                <Li><h4>Personal Care.</h4> <p>Caregivers may help with daily activities such as dressing, bathing, toileting, or arranging child care.</p></Li>
                <li><h4>Household Tasks.</h4><p> Caregivers are often in charge of preparing meals, doing chores or laundry, shopping for groceries or paying bills.</p></li>
                <li><h4>Emotional Support.</h4><p> When faced with a serious diagnosis, patients are often overwhelmed by the emotional and physical turmoil. Caregivers are tasked with the important duty of providing support and encouragement for the patients as well as themselves. Communication is key in the relationship between a caregiver and a patient. It is important to both openly share feelings and remain empathetic to the situation.</p></li>
                <li><h4>Medical Care.</h4><p> Caregivers must be present, take notes, ask questions and assist loved ones in making decisions with the care team. They may also be responsible for administering, ordering, and picking up medication, providing transportation to appointments, and dealing with scheduling, billing, or insurance issues. Caregivers may also assist with other medical processes such as physical therapy, injections, feeding tubes, etc.</p></li>
